    <p>The following sets out the basic terms upon which I/We would be prepared to purchase the
        property above-mentioned. The terms are not comprehensive and I/We expect that additional
        terms will be  incorporated into a formal agreement (Contract to Sell/ Deed of Absolute Sale).
    </p>

    <div class="terms-conditions">
        <p>I further acknowledge and agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                That the Reservation Fee is <strong>NON-REFUNDABLE</strong> and <strong>NON-TRANSFERABLE.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                That any transfer or assignment of rights without the written approval of {{ company }} <strong>(VENDOR)</strong>
                is null and void, and shall cause for the cancellation of this Reservation Agreement and forfeiture of the Reservation Fee
                and other payments already made to the <strong>VENDOR</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                That <strong> failure to submit documentary requirements within SIXTY (60) DAYS from date of reservation and/or failure to pay THREE (3)
                consecutive monthly installments or its value equivalent in principal, penalties and interest, over-due taxes and assessments levied
                on the property during the term of this contract, by virtue of the mere fact of non-submission and/or non-payment, shall render this
                Agreement automatically ineffective and deemed cancelled without prior notice or court action,</strong> and the subject unit shall be offered for
                sale by Alsons Development and Investment Corporation to other prospective buyers.
            </li>
            <li>
                That non-delivery of the signed copy of the Contract to Sell to the <strong>VENDOR</strong> shall not delay the commencement of monthly installments. However,
                should the buyer not sign and return the Contract within three (3) months from down payment, it is understood that the buyer is not interested to
                continue with the purchase and the <strong>VENDOR</strong>  may cause the cancellation of the contract. 
            </li>
            <li>
                That <strong>equity payments should be covered with Post Dated Checks payable to ALSONS DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT
                CORPORATION or ALSONS DEV. A penalty of 2% per month, compounded monthly, shall be charged on overdue accounts.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                That the processing and transfer fees including but not limited to documentary stamps tax, transfer fees, registration fees, notarial fees and other

                payment of account. <br><br>
                In case of non-payment of these fees and related charges as required, Alsons Development and Investment Corporation may execute a Unilateral
                Deed of Sale. This means that the corresponding taxes and fees shall already be due and payable to the government agencies, as scheduled.
                It is understood that all charges including interest and penalties arising from non-payment of processing fees shall be for the account of the
                buyer.
            </li>
            <li>
                That the name to indicate in the Contract to Sell and Deed of Absolute Sale shall be:

            tax because of my late payment of accounts due. And should Alsons Development and Investment Corporation advance such tax payments (whichmay include penalties, surcharge, interests and other fees that may be charged), I shall pay, in addition to the payments made by Alsons Development
            and Investment Corporation, an additional interest to be computed from the date of payment until the same is reimbursed by me, at 16% per annum
